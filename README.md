# latkUnity
Read and write Latk files in Unity. (Last tested with Unity 2018.4.)

To use in a Unity project, add the repo folder to your Assets folder, or download a package from Releases.

To include in a Unity git project as a submodule, go to your project root in the terminal and type:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/LightningArtist/latkUnity ./Assets/latkUnity

```

Experimental: to include as a package (Unity 2018.4 and later), edit your project's ./Packages/manifest.json file:
```
"org.lightningartist.latkunity": "https://github.com/LightningArtist/latkUnity.git"  
```
